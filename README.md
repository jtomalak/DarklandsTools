DarklandsTools
==============

This is a repository of basic tools for the Microprose game 'Darklands'.
This was created because the existing tools are OLD and some do have their source
available but there doesn't seem to be a canonical reference for the data and save file
formats.

Right now this repo is very young and there's not much here yet, only some initial, and
incomplete, code to dump save files (specifically quests). In the future there will be
a number of cross-platform utilities, possibly even with accompanying GUI. Additionally
there will be documentation detailing the various file formats as learnt via experimentation
and reverse engineering (both of the Darklands data files and existing utility source code).
